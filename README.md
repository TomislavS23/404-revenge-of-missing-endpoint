<h2 style="text-align: center;">🔥 404: Revenge of the Missing Endpoint</h2>
*"A web app that fights the horrors of broken APIs, encoding chaos, and validation despair—with extreme prejudice."*

Ever tried parsing a Chinese API without proper character support? *Yeah, it’s a nightmare.* This project is your crash course in:
- **Brutal data validation** (XML/XSD? JSON? We *break* it so you don’t have to).
- **SOAP** (Do you want to “clean” your data? Too bad—here’s an old (WSDL) tech for you.)
- **JAXB, XML-RPC** (Like finding a VHS tape in your Netflix queue - we resurrect dead protocols (except maybe JAXB) for your "enjoyment").
- **Chinese API roulette** (Random products, mysterious endpoints, and *zero guarantees*).
- **Encoding wars** (Watch your terminal scream as it meets UTF-8’s evil twin GB2312.).
- **Questionable user authentication** (Authentication? Maybe. Encryption? Just enough that it looks like someone actually cares).

Bored? Desperate? Just like pain? **This app is your new therapist.**
