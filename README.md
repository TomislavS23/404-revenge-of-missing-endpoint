</div>

*"A web app that fights the horrors of broken APIs, encoding chaos, and validation despair‚Äîwith extreme prejudice."*

Ever tried parsing a Chinese API without proper character support? *Yeah, it‚Äôs a nightmare.* This project is your crash
course in:

- **Brutal data validation** (XML/XSD? JSON? We *break* it so you don‚Äôt have to).
- **SOAP** (Do you want to ‚Äúclean‚Äù your data? Too bad‚Äîhere‚Äôs an old (WSDL) tech for you.)
- **JAXB, XML-RPC** (Like finding a VHS tape in your Netflix queue - we resurrect dead protocols (except maybe JAXB) for
  your "enjoyment").
- **Chinese API roulette** (Random products, mysterious endpoints, and *zero guarantees*).
- **Encoding wars** (Watch your terminal scream as it meets UTF-8‚Äôs evil twin GB2312.).
- **Questionable user authentication** (Authentication? Maybe. Encryption? Just enough that it looks like someone
  actually cares).

Bored? Desperate? Just like pain? **This app is your new therapist.**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites (ArchLinux)

1. Installed Node Package Manager and Node.JS

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
    ```

2. Installed docker

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S docker docker-buildx
    ```

3. Enable docker socket

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl enable docker.socket
    ```

4. Pull PostgreSQL image from official Docker repo

    ```shell
    docker pull postgres
    ```

### Installation

1. Configure environment variables.

> An example of required environment variables can be found in `/src/main/resources/environment` folder.

2. Clone the repo.
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:TomislavS23/404-revenge-of-missing-endpoint.git
   ```
3. Open `/app` folder in your favourite IDE (like Jetbrains Webstorm) and install required npm packages.
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
4. Start your docker PSQL image.
   ```shell
   docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```
5. Connect to your PSQL instance and create "404rme" database by running this command in your favourite RDBMS.

   ```postgresql
   CREATE DATABASE "404rme"
   ```
6. Run the SQL script located in `/src/main/resources/database` folder.
7. Open IntelliJ IDEA and start the API.

> Access swagger interface using this link: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

8. Open your favourite editor and run the webapp.

## Usage

This project is basically just a playground to mess around with some tech ‚Äì both new stuff and old things nobody uses
anymore.

You can:

- Try out whatever features are there
- Test the APIs if you feel like it
- Play with the validation stuff
- See what happens when things break (which they will)

No pressure, no fancy goals ‚Äì just poke around and see what this thing does.
